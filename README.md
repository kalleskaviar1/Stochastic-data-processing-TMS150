# Stochastic-data-processing-TMS150

This repository contains four assignments from the course **Stochastic-data-processing-TMS150**.

### [Assignment A1: Bike-Sharing Data Analysis](Assigment_One.R)
**Topics:** Regression, Box-Cox transformation, prediction intervals, model selection
**Description:**
- Analyzes real-world bike-sharing data to explore regression techniques.
- Uses Box-Cox transformation to improve model fit and symmetry of residuals.
- Implements training/testing splits and evaluates model performance using pMSE.
- **Key Files:** `Assignment_A1_TMS150.pdf`, R code in Appendix
